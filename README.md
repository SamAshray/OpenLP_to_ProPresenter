# OpenLP_to_ProPresenter
A Python script to convert OpenLP song export files which are in .xml format to .txt format, which then later can be imported by ProPresenter easily.
! The Script will only convert the Verse 1 (V1) in OpenLP Song Editor of each song !


Steps to use the script:
1) In OpenLP,  Go to File > Export > Songs. (Choose requried songs, and remember the path to the folder where the songs are saved.)
2) In main.py, line 36, Enter the path to the folder mentioned above.
3) In line 37, Enter the path where you want the outputed files to be stored.
4) Run main.py
5) End
See main.py comments for more info

Refer to example.py, which I have to used on English/ Telugu songs in OpenLP, to convert into text files.
